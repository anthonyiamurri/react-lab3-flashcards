# Treasure Hunt

Do your best to come up with answers (at least guesses) to these questions, but
don't take too long on each. I just want to get you thinking about these things.

1. What values do the bars in the graph start out at? (See reducers/index.js.)

2. Where does the graph get its data?

3. What happens when the buttons are clicked?

4. What functions are in actions/index.js?

5. Why so many files named index.js?

6. List as many things as you can that you see in this app that you haven't seen
   in our other examples so far.
